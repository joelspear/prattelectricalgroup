    content: `Solar energy continues to be one of the smartest investments for Adelaide homeowners. With South Australia having the highest electricity prices in the country and among the best sunshine hours, the numbers stack up better here than almost anywhere else in Australia.

## What Does a Solar System Cost in Adelaide?

The cost of solar in Adelaide depends on several factors: system size, panel quality, inverter choice, and whether you add battery storage. Here's a breakdown of typical costs in 2026 after applying the Small-scale Technology Certificate (STC) rebate:

**Residential Solar System Costs (after STCs):**

- **5kW system:** $3,500 – $5,500
- **6.6kW system:** $4,500 – $7,000
- **10kW system:** $7,000 – $10,000
- **13kW system:** $9,000 – $13,000

These prices include quality tier-1 panels, a reputable inverter, full installation, and all electrical work. Cheaper options exist, but we always recommend investing in quality components that will perform reliably for 25+ years.

## Battery Storage Costs

Adding a battery to your solar system allows you to store excess solar energy for use at night, significantly increasing your self-consumption and reducing your reliance on the grid.

**Popular Battery Options:**

- **5kWh battery:** $5,000 – $7,000
- **10kWh battery:** $9,000 – $13,000
- **13.5kWh battery (e.g., Tesla Powerwall):** $12,000 – $16,000

Battery costs have been decreasing steadily, and with South Australia's high electricity prices, the payback period for batteries is shorter here than in most other states.

## Government Rebates and STCs

The federal government provides a rebate through Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs). The value of STCs fluctuates but currently provides a discount of approximately $2,500 – $4,500 depending on your system size and location.

**Key points about STCs:**
- Available to all Australian homeowners
- Applied as an upfront discount on your system cost
- Your installer (that's us) handles all the paperwork
- Must be installed by a Clean Energy Council accredited installer

## What's the Payback Period?

For a typical Adelaide household, the payback period for solar looks like this:

- **6.6kW system without battery:** 3 – 4 years
- **6.6kW system with 10kWh battery:** 5 – 7 years
- **10kW system without battery:** 3 – 5 years

After the payback period, your solar system generates essentially free electricity for the remaining 20+ years of its life.

## Choosing the Right System Size

The right system size depends on your household's electricity usage:

- **Small household (1-2 people):** 5kW system
- **Average household (3-4 people):** 6.6kW system
- **Large household or high usage:** 10kW – 13kW system
- **Planning to add EV charging:** Consider 10kW+ system

We always recommend getting a personalised assessment rather than guessing. Our team analyses your electricity bills, roof space, and energy goals to recommend the optimal system.

## Why Choose an SAA Accredited Installer?

SAA accreditation is your guarantee that the installer meets the highest Australian standards for solar installation. It ensures:

- Proper system design and sizing
- Correct installation techniques
- Eligibility for all government rebates
- Ongoing compliance with industry standards

Pratt Electrical Group is proud to be SAA accredited, giving you peace of mind that your investment is in expert hands.`,

      "Electrician performing switchboard upgrade in Adelaide home",
    content: `Your switchboard is the heart of your home's electrical system. It distributes power to every circuit in your house and provides critical safety protection. But if your switchboard is outdated, it could be putting your family at risk.

## What Does a Switchboard Do?

Your switchboard (also called a meter board or fuse box) receives electricity from the grid and distributes it through your home via individual circuits. Modern switchboards include circuit breakers and safety switches (RCDs) that protect against electrical faults and reduce the risk of electrocution and electrical fires.

## 5 Warning Signs Your Switchboard Needs Upgrading

### 1. Ceramic Fuses Instead of Circuit Breakers

If your switchboard still uses ceramic fuses (the ones with fuse wire), it's definitely time for an upgrade. Ceramic fuses were standard in homes built before the 1980s, but they don't provide the same level of protection as modern circuit breakers. They also can't be fitted with safety switches.

### 2. No Safety Switches (RCDs)

Safety switches, also known as Residual Current Devices (RCDs), are designed to protect people from electrocution. They detect tiny imbalances in electrical current and shut off power in milliseconds. South Australian regulations now require RCDs on all power and lighting circuits. If your switchboard doesn't have them, upgrading is a safety priority.

### 3. Frequently Tripping Circuits

If your circuit breakers trip regularly, it could indicate that your circuits are overloaded. This often happens in older homes where the electrical system wasn't designed for modern appliances like air conditioners, electric ovens, and EV chargers. A switchboard upgrade can add additional circuits to distribute the load.

### 4. You're Adding Solar or an EV Charger

Installing solar panels or an EV charger requires adequate switchboard capacity. If your existing switchboard is full or outdated, an upgrade will be necessary before these new systems can be connected. It's often cost-effective to do the switchboard upgrade at the same time as the solar or EV charger installation.

### 5. Burning Smell or Discolouration

If you notice a burning smell near your switchboard, scorch marks on the board, or discoloured wiring, stop using affected circuits immediately and call a licensed electrician. These are serious warning signs that indicate potential fire risk.

## What Does a Switchboard Upgrade Involve?

A typical switchboard upgrade includes:

- Removing the old switchboard and fuses
- Installing a new switchboard with circuit breakers
- Adding safety switches (RCDs) to all circuits
- Ensuring adequate capacity for your current and future needs
- Testing all circuits for compliance
- Issuing a Certificate of Compliance

## How Much Does a Switchboard Upgrade Cost?

In Adelaide, a standard switchboard upgrade typically costs between $800 and $2,500 depending on the size of your home, the number of circuits, and any additional work required. We provide free quotes so you know the exact cost before work begins.

## Do I Need Council Approval?

No, a switchboard upgrade doesn't require council approval. However, all electrical work must be performed by a licensed electrician and a Certificate of Compliance must be issued upon completion.`,

    content: `Battery storage is the next frontier for solar energy in South Australia. With the state's high electricity prices and generous sunshine, adding a battery to your solar system can significantly increase your energy savings and provide backup power during outages.

## How Does Solar Battery Storage Work?

During the day, your solar panels generate electricity. Without a battery, any excess power you don't use immediately is exported to the grid — and the feed-in tariff you receive for that export is much lower than the price you pay to buy electricity back at night.

A battery stores that excess solar energy so you can use it in the evening and overnight, dramatically reducing the amount of expensive grid electricity you need to buy.

## The Numbers: Is It Worth It in SA?

South Australia has some unique factors that make battery storage more attractive here than in most other states:

**High Electricity Prices:** SA electricity prices average 35-45 cents per kWh, among the highest in Australia. Every kWh you can self-consume from your battery saves you this full retail rate.

**Low Feed-in Tariffs:** Most SA feed-in tariffs are now 5-10 cents per kWh. This means the "value gap" between exporting solar and using it yourself is around 25-35 cents per kWh — and that's what a battery captures.

**Frequent Grid Instability:** SA has experienced more grid stability issues than other states, making backup power from batteries particularly valuable.

## Battery Costs and Payback

Here's how the numbers typically work out for a South Australian household:

**10kWh Battery System:**
- Cost: $9,000 – $13,000
- Daily savings: $3 – $6 (depending on usage patterns)
- Annual savings: $1,100 – $2,200
- Payback period: 5 – 8 years
- Battery warranty: 10 years

**Key factors affecting your payback:**
- Your household electricity usage patterns
- Your current electricity tariff
- The size of your existing solar system
- Whether you're on a time-of-use tariff

## Blackout Protection

Beyond the financial benefits, batteries provide backup power during blackouts. Standard solar systems shut down during a grid outage for safety reasons. With a battery and a backup circuit, your essential appliances can continue running when the grid goes down.

This is particularly valuable in South Australia, which has experienced several significant power outages in recent years.

## Popular Battery Options

**Tesla Powerwall 2 (13.5kWh)**
- One of the most popular residential batteries in Australia
- 10-year warranty
- Excellent app for monitoring
- Can be stacked for larger capacity

**BYD Battery-Box (various sizes)**
- Modular design — start small, add more later
- Competitive pricing
- 10-year warranty
- Compatible with most inverters

**Enphase IQ Battery (various sizes)**
- Modular micro-storage approach

## Should You Get a Battery Now or Wait?

Battery prices have been steadily declining, and technology continues to improve. However, with current SA electricity prices, the economics already work for many households. If you have an existing solar system that's exporting significant energy, adding a battery now makes financial sense.

Our recommendation: If your electricity bills are still significant despite having solar, a battery is likely worth the investment. We can analyse your solar generation data and usage patterns to give you a clear picture of the potential savings.`,
